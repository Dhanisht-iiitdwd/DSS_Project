Wind Turbine Power Prediction
In this study I am going to predict a wind turbine power production by using the wind speed, wind direction, month and hour data.

The dataset consists of 50530 observations. In order to demonstrate my data science skills with big data, I am going to use Pyspark library.

The dataset contains:

Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)
