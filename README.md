In this study, we aim to predict wind turbine power production by leveraging wind speed, wind direction, month, and hour data. Our approach combines these key factors to develop a predictive model that enhances wind energy efficiency and aids in grid stability.

The dataset comprises a substantial 50,530 observations, showcasing the scale and complexity of the data at hand. To harness the power of big data and demonstrate data science proficiency, we have chosen to utilize the PySpark library, well-known for its capacity to handle large datasets efficiently.

The dataset is expected to contain extensive information, likely encompassing historical records of wind turbine power production alongside related meteorological and temporal data. With PySpark, we can process and analyze this voluminous dataset, extracting valuable insights and patterns to create a predictive model for wind turbine power production. This endeavor highlights the significance of leveraging advanced tools and techniques in the realm of data science to address the challenges presented by large-scale datasets in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)
